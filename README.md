## 👨‍🎓 About the Project

This project was created as part of my learning journey in C programming.  
I'm a computer engineering student and wanted to practice basic concepts such as:
- Random number generation
- Loops and conditionals
- User input/output
- Code readability

I used ChatGPT to better understand some concepts and to guide me with best practices,  
but I wrote the code myself and made sure I fully understood how each part works. 🧠

## 🕹️ Game Description

The game is simple:  
- The computer randomly picks a number between **1 and 100** 🎲  
- The player has to guess it  
- After each guess, the game tells whether the number is **higher 🔼** or **lower 🔽**  
- When the correct number is guessed ✅, it shows the total number of attempts
